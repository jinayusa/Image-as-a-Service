# Image Recognition as a Service

This project provides a solution for real-time face recognition using AWS services like **S3**, **SQS**, and **EC2**. It uses **React.js** for the frontend and **AWS Amplify** to integrate AWS services. The face recognition engine is built using **TensorFlow.js** and **OpenCV**.

## Project Overview

This project allows users to:
- Upload images for real-time face recognition.
- Visualize face detection results in the frontend.
- Upload images to **AWS S3** and send messages to **AWS SQS** for further processing.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Face Recognition**: TensorFlow.js, OpenCV
- **AWS**: Amplify, S3, SQS
- **Backend**: Node.js (for handling AWS service interactions)
- **Additional Tools**: Webpack, Babel

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- AWS account (for accessing S3, SQS)
- AWS CLI configured with access keys (or use AWS Amplify)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-recognition-service.git
cd image-recognition-service
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies for both the frontend (React) and backend (Node.js).

1. **Install React App Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in both the frontend and backend directories and add the following variables (replace placeholders with your actual values):

#### Frontend `.env`

```bash
REACT_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
REACT_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=your-region
```

#### Backend `.env`

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=your-region
```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the Backend Server**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Run the React App**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

### AWS Configuration

1. **Create an IAM User** in AWS and configure programmatic access with the required permissions (e.g., **AmazonS3FullAccess** and **AmazonSQSFullAccess**).
2. **Configure AWS Amplify** in the React app (optional, if using Amplify):

   - Install AWS Amplify:
     ```bash
     npm install aws-amplify
     ```
   - In your `src/index.js`:
     ```javascript
     import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
     import awsconfig from './aws-exports';  // Generate this file using Amplify CLI

     Amplify.configure(awsconfig);
     ```

3. **Configure the S3 bucket** and **SQS queue** in AWS. Ensure that these services are accessible and properly configured with the correct permissions.

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image**: Use the file input in the React app to upload an image for face detection.
2. **View Results**: The detected faces will be shown in the UI, with the number of faces detected and their details.
3. **Monitor Activity**: View real-time monitoring of uploaded images and detected faces in the dashboard.

### Customization Notes:

- Replace `your-username`, `your-access-key-id`, `your-secret-access-key`, and `your-region` with your actual GitHub username and AWS credentials.
- If you're using AWS Amplify, be sure to replace the `awsconfig` with the correct Amplify configuration that you generate using the Amplify CLI.
